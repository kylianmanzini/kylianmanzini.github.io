    <h1 class="title">Hi! i'm <span class="blue">Kylian</span>.</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle"><span class="blue">Software Engineer</span> from Switzerland</h2>

    <p>With a foundation in web design and a passion for programming, I embarked back in 2016 on a journey that led me through a CFC in Mediamatics and a Bachelor's in Software Engineering.</p>

    <p>During internships in both English and Swiss companies, I gained hands-on experience and discovered my love for software engineering. Now, I'm excited to bring my creativity and technical skills to a dynamic team where I can contribute and grow. </p>
